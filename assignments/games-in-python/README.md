### 🛠️	Create Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list of at least 5 words
- Display the word as underscores (e.g., `_ _ _ _ _`) with spaces between letters
- Accept single letter guesses from the player and validate input
- Update the display to show correctly guessed letters in their positions
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining (start with 6 attempts)
- Show all previously guessed letters to avoid duplicate guesses
- End the game when the word is completely guessed (win) or attempts run out (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
